    <p class="lead" style="padding: 30px">Welcome, and thank you for checking out my portfolio page! My name is Thomas and was born in Northern California and raised in beautiful Santa Barbara. As a child I was always very curious, always hungry to know why things worked. As a youngster I was introduced to the wondrous world of tech by my father who happily let me help him build a few gaming PCs. From putting together the hardware to playing the games, the process satisfied my mind in a way nothing had before. As I’ve grown this curiosity has not dwindled, and thus my college career consists of a spattering of classes ranging in subject from philosophy to neuroscience. I’ve come to realize that my undying curiosity and the joy I find in understanding complex relationships are a set of skills which would serve me well in that field I first fell in love with, tech.

      <br/><br/>To that end, I’m currently enrolled in the Full Stack Development course with MERN offered by MIT. I look forward to furthering my understanding of this field and I’m eager to work with a wide range of clients in a way that fully utilizes both the skills I’ve learned and the the skills to come.
      
      <br/><br/>The purpose of this page is to showcase what I’ve learned, so be sure to check in periodically for updates.
      If you have any questions or suggestions please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email
